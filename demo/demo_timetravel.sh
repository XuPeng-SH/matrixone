echo "This demo will show how to use Time Travel queries with MatrixOne"
echo "The syntax is: SELECT * FROM table {MO_TS=timestamp}"
echo "Where timestamp is converted from user-friendly format like '2025-09-09 13:06:20'"
echo ""
echo "Example queries you can run:"
echo "1. Query data before AI annotation: 2025-09-09 13:06:20"
echo "2. Query data after AI annotation: 2025-09-09 13:06:24"
echo "3. Query current state: current"
echo ""
echo "To test Time Travel queries:"
echo "1. Run: ./ai_dataset_demo -host 10.222.1.52 -interactive"
echo "2. Choose option 5 (Time Travel Query)"
echo "3. Enter a timestamp like: 2025-09-09 13:06:20"
echo ""
echo "The system will:"
echo "- Convert '2025-09-09 13:20:04' to MatrixOne TS format (physical timestamp)"
echo "- Execute: SELECT * FROM ai_dataset {MO_TS=1757424004000000000}"
echo "- Show the data state at that specific time point"
echo ""
echo "Example conversion:"
echo "  Input:  2025-09-09 13:20:04"
echo "  Output: 1757424004000000000 (MatrixOne TS physical timestamp)"

echo "This demonstrates MatrixOne's Git for Data capabilities!"
